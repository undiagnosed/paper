The paper will discuss the ways patients are becoming more empowered via decentralized technologies to fight the oppression that exists in the healthcare system. It will frame the problem in the context of a left-libertarian political philosophy and argue that government intervention in the market results in artificial scarcity of products and services that leads to poorer access and outcomes.
