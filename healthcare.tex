\section{Rapid Technological Evolution Empowering Individuals}

\subsection{Decentralized Technologies}


music, film industries
energy, etc.
p2p, bitorrent, file sharing, circumventing IP laws
blockchain, bitcoin, circumventing middleman institution
darknet markets
crowd funding, gofundme, medical bills, charity
sharing economy, uber, airb\&b, OpenBazaar products and services, platform cooperativism, eliminate middleman
decentralized web, ZeroNet, censorship resistance

\subsection{Applied Agorism}

%Agorism is a revolutionary left-libertarian political philosophy that advocates the goal of bringing about a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics.

%http://agorism.info/

%Agorism
%The ideology which asserts that the Libertarian philosophical position occurs in the real world in practice as Counter-Economics.
%Agorist
%Advocate or conscious practitioner of Counter-Economics, older terms include left libertarian and New Libertarian.
%Counter-Economics
%The study and/or practice of all peaceful human action which is forbidden by the State.
%Libertarian
%One who opposes state intervention, i.e., a defender of Liberty.
%Libertarian Left
%Activist, organization, publication or tendency which opposes parliamentarianism (electoral politics), defends Counter-Economists, and prefers alliances with radical and revolutionary tendencies to those with conservative ones.


\section{Healthcare Monopoly Complicit With Poor Access and Outcomes}
\subsection{Misdiagnosis}

\subsection{Disenfranchised Patient Groups}

\subsubsection{Rare Diseases}

CVID

\subsubsection{Unusual Disease Presentations}

seronegative HIV

\subsubsection{Under Studied Diseases}

% rare diseases, rare presentations, emerging diseases
ME/CFS

\subsubsection{Emerging Diseases}

\subsection{Scarcity of Capable Doctors}

% developing world lack of doctors
% lack of capable doctors in developed & developing world

The developing world has a major shortage of doctors. For example Nigeria has roughly 14\% the number of doctors as OECD countries. \cite{wef2014}

% lack of access, scarcity
% unaffordable

vet anecdote

%Took my 13 year old dog to the vet and in one visit they aspirated a lump to check for fatty tissue or cancer, performed cheap ultrasound as vet was not board certified, vaccinations, physical.

\subsection{Unjust Authoritarian System}
% systemic bias and inability to overule faulty doctor opinion
% systemic problem
% lack of patient power, authoritarian system, doctors in control
% patients prevented from ordering own tests


\subsection{Limited Direct Patient Testing, Doctor a Middleman}

Doctors are a middleman and serve as a barrier to access testing. Systemic problems exist where seeking alterate opinions does not guarantee improved outcome. Doctors are educated similarly and will have biases prevalent in the population.

\cite{scholz2016platform}

% deep mind streams data sharing regulatory impedance
% importance of patient owned uncensorable platform that cannot be shutdown by government
% special treatment from government, DeepMind exclusive access to data that is tax payer funded

% patientslikeme have issues with this?

\subsection{Accessing Testing}

In US, going to states that allow direct patient testing
% data sharing medications
% access to medication

\subsection{Access to Procedures}

% concerns about anonymity
% de anonymizing cases and review

% access to lab tests (bloodborne)

online lab test services

\subsection{Homebrew Medical Devices Increasing Prevalence}

%the way in which falling capital outlays required for both information and material production was eroding the rationale for large organizations, and shifting the balance of power toward individuals, small groups and networks.  In particular, I focused on the radically reduced capital outlays required for manufacturing were giving rise to a low-overhead micromanufacturing economy in which the large quantities of land and capital to which the privileged classes had access were becoming increasingly irrelevant, and the material basis for the factory system and wage employment was collapsing.
